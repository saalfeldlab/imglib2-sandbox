# imglib2-sandbox
Test some ImgLib2 code

Currently, the purpose of this sandbox is to experiment with `Functions` and `BiConverters` that are not yet released.  So in order to compile some of the examples, you will need the [functions branch of ImgLib2](https://github.com/imglib/imglib2/tree/functions) built locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/imglib/imglib2.git
cd imglib2
git checkout functions
mvn clean install
```

Now maven will find it.
